# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

# TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"),

# TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles.

# # STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline
# and description using list comprehension.

# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.

# Optional
# TODO: Format the message like this:
